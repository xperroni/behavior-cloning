# Behavioral Cloning - End-to-end Deep Learning Autonomous Steering

This project demonstrates the use of convolutional networks and deep learning to perform *behavioral cloning*, that is, the learning and reproduction of a (presumably human) driver's responses to different road conditions.

## Architectures

Two architectures were implemented in this project. The first one
