Idea for generating dataset:

1. Do three runs, in the middle of the road, the left and right borders;
2. Wiggle left and right on all three runs;
3. In the middle run, invert the angular acceleration of records (the idea is to nulify any turning in the middle);
4. In the right, invert all turns right;
5. In the left, invert all turns left.
